# module: aoscx_command

description: This module allows execution of CLI commands on AOS-CX devices via SSH connection. 
Although this module can execute configuration commands, there is another module designed to execute
just configuration commands, aoscx_config.

##### NOTES
* `aoscx_command` will not handle commands that repeat forever such as `repeat` 
* Besides simple "yes/no" prompts, `aoscx_command` is unable to process commands which require user input
	* This includes operations such as password entry
    * If a command requires a "yes/no" confirmation, include the line `auto-confirm` at the beginning of the task, like in the below example
        * `auto-confirm` does not allow copying AOS-CX images with TFTP
```yaml
- hosts: all
    roles:
      - role: aoscx-ansible-role
    tasks:
      - name: VSF Renumber-To with Autoconfirm
        aoscx_command:
          lines: [
            'auto-confirm',
            'configure',
            'vsf renumber-to 2',
          ]
```


##### ARGUMENTS
```YAML
  commands:
    description: List of commands to be executed in sequence on the switch. Every command
      will attempt to be executed regardless of the success or failure of the previous 
      command in the list. To execute commands in the 'configure' context, you must include 
      the 'configure terminal' command or one of its variations before the configuration commands. 
      'Show' commands are valid and their output will be printed to the screen, returned by the 
      module, and optionally saved to a file. The default module timeout is 30 seconds. To change the 
      command timeout, set the variable 'ansible_command_timeout' to the desired time in seconds.
    required: True
    type: list

  wait_for:
    description: A list of conditions to wait to be satisfied before continuing execution.
      Each condition must include a test of the 'result' variable, which contains the output 
      results of each already-executed command in the 'commands' list. 'result' is a list
      such that result[0] contains the output from commands[0], results[1] contains the output 
      from commands[1], and so on.  
    required: False
    type: list
    
  match:
    description: Specifies whether all conditions in 'wait_for' must be satisfied or if just 
      any one condition can be satisfied. To be used with 'wait_for'.
    default: 'all'
    choice: ['any', 'all']
    required: False
    type: str
        
  retries:
    description: Maximum number of retries to check for the expected prompt.
    default: 10
    required: False
    type: int

  interval:
    description: Interval between retries, in seconds.
    default: 1
    required: False
    type: int

  output_file:
    description: Full path of the local system file to which commands' results will be output.
    The directory must exist, but if the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
    required: False
    type: str

  output_file_format:
    description: Format to output the file in, either JSON or plain text.
    To be used with 'output_file'.
    default: json
    choices: ['json', 'plain-text']
    required: False
    type: str
